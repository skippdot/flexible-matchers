## Unique Value Proposition

### Why `flexible-matchers` is Better

**vs. unittest.mock.ANY**
- Too permissive (matches everything)
- Our matchers provide precise validation

**vs. PyHamcrest**
- Requires special `assert_that()` syntax
- We use natural Python `==` operator

**vs. dirty-equals**
- Missing `CLOSE_NUMBER` with tolerance
- Missing flexible string length constraints
- We have both unique features

**vs. pychoir**
- Less intuitive API (requires combining matchers)
- Our API is simpler and more Pythonic

**vs. callee**
- Abandoned since 2019
- We're actively maintained

### Key Differentiators
1. **Zero Dependencies**- Lightweight and fast
2. **CLOSE_NUMBER**- Tolerance-based matching (unique!)
3. **Flexible STRING**- min/max length constraints (unique!)
4. **Natural Syntax**- Uses standard `==` operator
5. **100% Coverage**- Well-tested and reliable

## Notes for Future Sessions

### Context for Resuming Work
1. This package was created from `tests/mock_helper.py` in the mapx-api project
2. The `ANY_NOT_NONE` matcher was recently added and is included
3. All code is tested and working - no bugs to fix
4. The package is **ready to publish**- just needs Git/GitHub/PyPI setup
5. All linters are configured and passing

### If You Need to Make Changes
1. Edit `src/flexible_matchers/__init__.py` for code changes
2. Edit `tests/test_matchers.py` for test changes
3. Run `pytest -v` to verify tests still pass
4. Run linters: `black src tests && isort src tests && ruff check src tests`
5. Rebuild if needed: `python -m build`

### If Tests Fail
1. Check the error message carefully
2. The most common issues are:
 - Import errors (check `__init__.py` exports)
 - Type mismatches (check type hints)
 - Edge cases (check boundary conditions)
3. Run specific test: `pytest tests/test_matchers.py::TestName::test_name -v`
4. Check coverage: `pytest --cov=flexible_matchers --cov-report=term-missing`
